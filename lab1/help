How to Use the Simple Test Cases:

1. Create a test directory in your home directory by

% mkdir ~/2431lab1

2. Change into the test directory

% cd ~/2431lab1

3. Copy the files for the lab, `shellA.c', and 'lab1Readme', into the test directory by

% cp /project/c2431ae01/lab1/* ./

4. Make the required modifications to the code in shellA.c, save, and compile your `shell.c' in test directory; you can use makefile if you like, or simply use

% gcc -g shellA.c -o mysh 

Now, if there is no error, you can begin to test your small
shell, ;-).

% mysh

* Simple Test Cases

----
COMMAND-> mv lab1Readme help 
Output: The `lab1Readme' file in the `2431lab1' directory should be
renamed to `help'.
----

----
COMMAND-> cat help 
Output: The content of this file should be printed onto the
screen.
----

----
COMMAND-> mysh
Output: Start a second `mysh' shell in the first `mysh' shell
The command prompt should be waiting for user's input. Enter 'ls' 
to list the files in the current directory.  When 
you press `Ctrl+d', you should go back into your first `mysh'.

* You should make up other text cases to try as well.
